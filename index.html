            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Next semester I am going to focus on studying for my classes and AP exams. I am hoping to be able to add another AP beyond the ones that I am already in. I also want to continue to volunteer and find internships for during the summer in order to get some experience.</p>
            <p>During the next two years I am going to finish my associates degree and get ready to transfer to a 4 year college. During my 13th year I am going to continue to find internships and job shadow people. This will hopefully be easier once I am a college student.</p>
            <p>Once I graduate from the 4 year university I plan on going into the job market for either programming or for cyber security. I also want to do a little bit of ballet costuming. I have always been interested in sewing and I did ballet for ten years so it is something that I am passionate about.</p>
