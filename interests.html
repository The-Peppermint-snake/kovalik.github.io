                <strong>Crochet</strong> I first learned to crochet from my grandmother so it's something that we can talk about together. I have made a few different stuffed animals but clothing like cardigans are my favorite things to make.

                <strong>Reading</strong> My favorite books that I have read this year are <em>The Priory of the Organge Tree</em>, <em>Babel</em> and <em>Legend Born</em>. My favorite genre is fantasy.

                <strong>Sewing</strong> I have always enjoyed sewing after I learned from my mother. I recently got a Singer VS 2 treadle sewing machine that I cleaned up. It was made in the 1890s.

                <strong>Historical Fashion</strong> I love learning about fashion history and how changes in society changed fashion and vice versa. My favorite time period has to be the 1890-1905.

                <strong>Baking</strong> My mother also taught me how to bake. She mostly taught me how to bake bread including sourdough and focaccia. But I also enjoy baking desserts such as cookies and tarts.
